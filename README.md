# Bitcoin Price Notification
Introduction:

As we all know, Cryptocurrency price is a fickle thing. You never really know where itâ€™s going to be at the end of the day. So, instead of constantly checking various sites for the latest updates, we are going to get the current price of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin in real time and plot this data in a graph on our local machine. The data will be stored using sqlite3. 


In order to get the latest price for Bitcoin we will be using the Coinmarketcap API. We send an HTTP GET request to the URL('https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest) and save the response. Since the API returns a JSON response, we can convert it to a Python object by calling the .json() function on the response. Then we will be using flask, matplotlib, bootstrap, html and css to properly display that data. 

We will be using the link at the bottom of the app.py file to display our data. In order to access it please follow the web address.
